### Abstract:
We studied Escherichia coli BW25113 growth in a complex medium with emphasis on amino acid consumption. The aim was to profile amino acid utilization in acid-hydrolysed casein and a defined nutrient-rich medium and based on these measurements modify the medium for better growth performance. Amino acid depletions in both media caused apparent biomass growth stops that prolonged growth duration. Obtained amino acid consumption values enabled a new defined medium to be formulated, where no growth stops were observed, the specific growth rate was constant, and the provided substrates were fully utilized. Similarly, we modified the acid-hydrolysed casein medium by adding pure amino acids that removed the apparent biomass growth stops. Key to our results was the combination of growth medium analysis and process monitoring data, specifically oxygen partial pressure and produced carbon dioxide that were used to track growth changes. Our findings showed the deficiencies of the nutrient-rich medium and how rational medium design, based on consumption values, removed these shortcomings. The resulting balanced medium gives a high specific growth rate and is suitable for studying E. coli physiology at fast growth.
