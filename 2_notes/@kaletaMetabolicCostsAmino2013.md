### Abstract:
Abstract Escherichia coli is the most popular microorganism for the production of recombinant proteins and is gaining increasing importance for the production of low‐molecular weight compounds such as amino acids. The [[metabolic cost]] associated with the [[production of amino acids]] and (recombinant) proteins from glucose, glycerol and acetate was determined using three different computational techniques to identify those amino acids that put the highest burden on the biosynthetic machinery of E. coli . Comparing the costs of individual amino acids, we find that methionine is the most expensive amino acid in terms of consumed mol of ATP per molecule produced, while leucine is the most expensive amino acid when taking into account the cellular abundances of amino acids. Moreover, we show that the biosynthesis of a large number of amino acids from glucose and particularly from glycerol provides a surplus of energy, which can be used to balance the high energetic cost of amino acid polymerization.

For the corresponding numbers for each protein of E. coli see Supplementary Data S1. B Histogram of the cost of the biosynthesis of all E. coli proteins (per residue and mole of protein) from various carbon sources. Costs are given as the average mass of carbon source (in Dalton) that is required per residue of the protein. Yields of individual amino acids from the ‘manual’ computations were used. Please note that these numbers include polymerization costs. For the corresponding numbers of each protein of E. coli see Supplementary Data S1.
