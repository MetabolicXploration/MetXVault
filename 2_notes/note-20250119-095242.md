Note that this is just saying:

$$\begin{align}
\ddot{x} &= -\frac{k}{m}x \\
\dot{x} &= \dot{x} \\
x &= x
\end{align}$$

That is, is making explicit that $\dot{x}$ and $x$ are not touched by the constraint. The dynamic is constrained, but not the values.

For instance, a more explicit example will be

$$\begin{align}
\ddot{x} &= \sin x \\
\dot{x} &= \dot{x} \\
x &= x
\end{align}$$

Here, $\ddot{x} \in [-1, 1]$ while $\dot{x}$ and $x$ values are unconstrained.
