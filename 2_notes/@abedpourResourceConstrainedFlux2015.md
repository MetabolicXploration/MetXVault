### Abstract:
A universal feature of metabolic networks is their hourglass or bow-tie structure on cellular level. This architecture reflects the conversion of multiple input nutrients into multiple biomass components via a small set of precursor metabolites. However, it is yet unclear to what extent this structural feature is the result of natural selection.

It has been shown that the concentrations for most intracellular metabolites are much higher than the KM values of the corresponding enzymatic reactions in E. coli [24]. #ImportantFact

This view is supported by the experimental fact that the increase of the protein production rate for an unnecessary protein linearly decreases the growth rate [5]. #ImportantFact
