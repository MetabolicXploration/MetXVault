### Abstract:
After hundreds of generations of adaptive evolution at exponential growth, Escherichia coli grows as predicted using flux balance analysis (FBA) on genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). However, it is not known whether the predicted pathway usage in FBA solutions is consistent with gene and protein expression in the wild-type and evolved strains. Here, we report that >98% of active reactions from FBA optimal growth solutions are supported by transcriptomic and proteomic data. Moreover, when E. coli adapts to growth rate selective pressure, the evolved strains upregulate genes within the optimal growth predictions, and downregulate genes outside of the optimal growth solutions. In addition, bottlenecks from dosage limitations of computationally predicted essential genes are overcome in the evolved strains. We also identify regulatory processes that may contribute to the development of the optimal growth phenotype in the evolved strains, such as the downregulation of known regulons and stringent response suppression. Thus, differential gene and protein expression from wild-type and adaptively evolved strains supports observed growth phenotype changes, and is consistent with GEM-computed optimal growth states.

## Results

> #Figure 2 In adaptive evolution through serial passaging, E. coli evolves to a higher growth rate and biomass yield at exponential growth. Growth rates and substrate uptake rates were acquired for each strain before and after adaptive evolution, as reported earlier ([[@ssParallelAdaptiveEvolution2005|Fong et al, 2005]]; Charusanti et al, submitted for publication). For growth on (A) glycerol, (B) lactate, and for (C) the Dpgi strain grown on glucose, the evolved strains (red) all improved their growth rate and biomass yield at exponential growth, compared with the unevolved parent strains (blue).
