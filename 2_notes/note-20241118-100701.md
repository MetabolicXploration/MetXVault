The [[inverse]] os a Matrix $A$ can be written as:

$$
\text{inv}\,A = \frac{1}{\det A} \text{adj}\,{A}
$$

where $\text{adj}\,{A}$ is the [[Adjugate matrix]]. 

So, a system of equations can be solved as:

$$\begin{align}
Ax &= b 
\\
x &= \text{inv}\,A \, b
\\
x &= \frac{1}{\det A} \text{adj}\,{A} \, b
\end{align}$$

> Why to chose this way? I don't know
