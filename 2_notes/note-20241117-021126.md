This last simplification is not required...

$$\begin{align}
\frac{c_0}{K} > \frac{\delta}{r_{max} - \delta} 
\end{align}$$

is the line dividing the [[washout]] regime from $n^* > 0$ cultures...

> #Figure This plot is produced by generating a set of $\delta$s and $c_0$s and fixing a $K$ and $r_{max}$. Later, you test whether both $\frac{c_0}{K} > \frac{\delta}{r_{max} - \delta}$ and  $\delta \leq r_{max}$ is true (yellow) or false (dark blue) for a given ($\delta, c_0$).
