> Here, in this study, genomic, transcriptomic, and 13C-metabolic flux analyses (13C-MFA) of an evolved E. coli strain adapted to BCHA tolerance were conducted.

#### lewisOmicDataEvolved2010

> Multiple strains of E. coli were subjected to adaptive evolution through serial passaging in three different M9-minimal media conditions: lactate, glycerol, and glucose (glucose grown strains had the glycolytic gene pgi deleted to perturb the normal flux into glycolysis). For each growth condition, three to six replicates of the adaptive process were performed in parallel until each strain had reached and maintained a steadygrowth rate, which typically took 700–1000 generations (see Fong et al, 2005, 2006 for details). Through adaptive evolution, all strains improved their growth rate and efficiency in converting substrate to biomass (yield) within the exponential growth phase (Figure 2).
> Fifty quantitative proteomic data sets were obtained from the wild-type and evolved strains. Within these data sets, 983 proteins were identified with high confidence, of which 731 were identified in all strains. An extended discussion on methods and an analysis of data content and quality can be found in the Supplementary information. Transcriptomic data for strains corresponding to two of the three growth conditions (lactate and glycerol) have been published earlier (Fong et al, 2005) and are also analyzed alongside the proteomic data in this study using the E. coli GEM as a context for the analysis.

#### bhadra-loboAssessmentTranscriptomicConstraintbased2020

> In this paper, we formed a dataset of transcriptomic data coupled with corresponding 13C-MFA flux data for 21 experimental conditions in different unicellular organisms grown on varying carbon substrates and conditions. Three computational flux-balance analysis (FBA) methods were comparatively assessed. The results show when uptake rates of carbon sources and key metabolites are known, transcriptomic data provides no significant advantage over constraint-based metabolic modeling (average correlation coefficients, transcriptomic E-Flux2 0.725 and SPOT 0.650 vs non-transcriptomic pFBA 0.768). When uptake rates are unknown, however, predictions obtained utilizing transcriptomic data are generally good and significantly better than those obtained using constraint-based metabolic modeling alone (E-Flux2 0.385 and SPOT 0.583 vs pFBA 0.237). Thus, transcriptomic data coupled with constraint-based metabolic modeling is a promising method to obtain intracellular flux estimates in microorganisms, particularly in cases where uptake rates of key metabolites cannot be easily determined, such as for growth in complex media or _in vivo_ conditions.

> Data and model for _E_. _coli_: For _E_. _coli_, both the measured gene expression (single color microarray) and 13C flux data were obtained from a previous study by Gerosa et al. [[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7480874/#pone.0238689.ref017)]. In this study, data were measured from _E_. _coli_ wild type BW25113 cells growing exponentially on eight different carbon sources: glucose, galactose, gluconate, fructose, glycerol, pyruvate, acetate, and succinate. We used iJO1366 [[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7480874/#pone.0238689.ref018)] as the genome-scale metabolic model.


#### kimEFlux2SPOTValidated2016

We examined _E_. _coli_ and _S_. _cerevisiae_ as representative prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms respectively. The predictive accuracy of our algorithm was validated by calculating the uncentered Pearson correlation between predicted fluxes and measured fluxes. To this end, we compiled 20 experimental conditions (11 in _E_. _coli_ and 9 in _S_. _cerevisiae_), of transcriptome measurements coupled with corresponding central carbon metabolism intracellular flux measurements determined by 13C metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA), which is the largest dataset assembled to date for the purpose of validating inference methods for predicting intracellular fluxes.

Each dataset was collected at approximately the same mid-exponential phase of growth [47,48], and contextualization of iJO1366 with RIPTiDe took only seconds to complete (S3B Fig).

The numbers represent absolute flux values ($mmol gCDW^{-1} h^{-1}$). One of two replicate experiments is shown (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). The presented fluxes are from one of two independent experiments and were obtained by 13C-constrained flux analysis using the software FiatFlux (Zamboni et al, 2005). They were independently confirmed by flux estimation with a whole isotopologue model (Kleijn et al, 2005; van Winden et al, 2005). Generally, the deviation between the two independent experiments was 1–5%, and whole isotopologue sensitivity analysis through addition of Gaussian noise confirmed accurate estimation for all major fluxes (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).

## S. cerevisiae

### @snitkinModeldrivenAnalysisExperimentally2008

> Results
In this study, we measured growth phenotypes of 465 _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ gene deletion mutants under 16 metabolically relevant conditions and integrated them with the corresponding flux balance model predictions.

### @gianchandaniPredictingBiologicalSystem2008

> A flux distribution for the central metabolic network was previously characterized experimentally [22, 23]. This distribution was obtained by GC-MS tracing of 13C-labeled isotopomers, and corresponds to yeast cells cultivated in batch culture with glucose as the limiting substrate and at a maximum specific growth rate, _μ_max, of 0.37 h-1. (See [23] for complete experimental details.)

### @osterlundMappingConditiondependentRegulation2013a

> #Figure **Model validation by comparing** **_in silico_** **prediction of the specific growth rate with experimental data.** Growth phenotypes were collected from literature and compared to simulated values for chemostat cultivations at four different conditions, nitrogen limited aerobic (green) and anaerobic (red), carbon limited aerobic (blue) and anaerobic (white).
> ![[Pasted image 20230425133918.png | 300]]


> The iTO977 model was used as a scaffold for integrated data analysis. Chemostat cultivations were performed at a dilution rate of 0.05 h-1 under the same four different conditions as used for simulations above (carbon limited, nitrogen limited, aerobic and anaerobic) and microarray data as well as external and intracellular flux measurements was obtained for each condition[20].

> The enzymes that have a direct link between change in expression and change in flux might be good targets for over-expression in order to direct the flux toward i.e. a desired product, since there is a coupling between expression and flux. We therefore used the random sampling algorithm[15] to identify reactions that change both in flux and transcription. These reactions are referred to as transcriptionally controlled reactions and can be seen as a subset of the global set of reactions that change transcriptionally.
