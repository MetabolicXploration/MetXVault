### Abstract:
Abstract Biological regulatory network architectures are multi-scale in their function and can adaptively acquire new functions. Gene knockout (KO) experiments provide an established experimental approach not just for studying gene function, but also for unraveling regulatory networks in which a gene and its gene product are involved. Here we study the regulatory architecture of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 by applying adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) to metabolic gene KO strains. Multi-omic analysis reveal a common overall schema describing the process of adaptation whereby perturbations in metabolite concentrations lead regulatory networks to produce suboptimal states, whose function is subsequently altered and re-optimized through acquisition of mutations during ALE. These results indicate that metabolite levels, through metabolite-transcription factor interactions, have a dominant role in determining the function of a multi-scale regulatory architecture that has been molded by evolution.

> Great work. It will be great to get all raw data from this study. he data gathering was very complete. The setup is also well design. The started from E. coli wild type and evolve it in glucose. From this optimized reference, they produce a group of metabolically meaningful KOs. After that, they evolve again every body to see the KOs strategies to recover optimality.
