### Abstract:
Abstract The goal of realistically and reliably simulating the biochemical processes underlying cellular function is achievable through a systematic approach that makes use of the broadest possible amount of in vitro and in vivo data, and is consistent with all applicable physical chemical theories. Progress will be facilitated by establishing: (1) a concrete self‐consistent theoretical foundation for systems simulation; (2) extensive and accurate databases of thermodynamic properties of biochemical reactions; (3) parameterized and validated models of enzyme and transporter catalytic mechanisms that are consistent with physical chemical theoretical foundation; and (4) software tools for integrating all these concepts, data, and models into a cohesive representation of cellular biochemical systems. Ongoing initiatives are laying the groundwork for the broad‐based community cooperation that will be necessary to pursue these elements of a strategic infrastructure for systems simulation on a large scale.
