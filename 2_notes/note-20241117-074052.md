### Robust Metabolic State

- We assume that the strains are in the same metabolic state disregard of co-culture partner 
- This way, we might be able to use the constraints of a co-culture to learn about the state of other. 
- For instance, we might claim that the state of a strain is the one that ensure at the same time, the measured yield for the strains in all co-cultures. 
- #ToTest A prediction of this setup is that the stain must have the same Yield in all co-cultures...
- The cooperation vector will be just a reflexion of the exchange pattern of the strain
	- That is, if we measure the exchange pattern of a mono-culture of the stain, we should be able to correlated with the cooperation vector. 
	- Im just using the partner strain to measure the exchange flux of a given metabolite. #Constraint
- This is a 'zero communication/coordination hypothesis' 
	- #NOTE See that their model have an objective function we demand a cooperation between cells. That is, minimizing $||J_A - J_W||$ and $||J_B - J_W||$ independently is not the same as $||(J_A - J_W) + (J_B - J_W)||$
