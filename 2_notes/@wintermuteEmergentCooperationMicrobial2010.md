### Abstract:
Mixed microbial communities exhibit emergent biochemical properties not found in clonal monocultures. We report a new type of synthetic genetic interaction, synthetic mutualism in trans (SMIT), in which certain pairs of auxotrophic Escherichia coli mutants complement one another's growth by cross‐feeding essential metabolites. We find significant metabolic synergy in 17% of 1035 such pairs tested, with SMIT partners identified throughout the metabolic network. Cooperative phenotypes show more growth on average by aiding the proliferation of their conjugate partner, thereby expanding the source of their own essential metabolites. We construct a quantitative, predictive, framework for describing SMIT interactions as governed by stoichiometric models of the metabolic networks of the interacting strains.

## Introduction

Recent studies have characterized the behavior of microbes in co-culture. Such strains may exhibit naturally complementary metabolism (Kim et al, 2008; Rozen et al, 2009; Hillesland and Stahl, 2010), or may be genetically engineered to interact (Shou et al, 2007; Balagadde´ et al, 2008; Gore et al, 2009). Interacting partners share metabolites, such as hydrogen (Hillesland and Stahl, 2010), acetate (Rozen et al, 2009), amino acids (Shou et al, 2007), fixed nitrogen (Kim et al, 2008) or glucose (Kim et al, 2008; Gore et al, 2009). In each case, it has been possible to extrapolate interactive dynamics from the individual characteristics of the participating strains. #ReferenceSource #Co-cultures #EColi #ToCheck
