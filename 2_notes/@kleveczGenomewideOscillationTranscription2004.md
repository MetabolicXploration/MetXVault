### Abstract:
Microarray analysis from a yeast continuous synchrony culture system shows a genomewide oscillation in transcription. Maximums in transcript levels occur at three nearly equally spaced intervals in this approximately 40-min cycle of respiration and reduction. Two temporal clusters (4,679 of 5,329) are maximally expressed during the reductive phase of the cycle, whereas a third cluster (650) is maximally expressed during the respiratory phase. Transcription is organized functionally into redox-state superclusters with genes known to be important in respiration or reduction being synthesized in opposite phases of the cycle. The transcriptional cycle gates synchronous bursts in DNA replication in a constant fraction of the population at 40-min intervals. Restriction of DNA synthesis to the reductive phase of the cycle may be an evolutionarily important mechanism for reducing oxidative damage to DNA during replication.
