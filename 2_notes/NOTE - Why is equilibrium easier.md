%% Note Body --------------------------------------------------- %%

%% Write here %%
Imaging an hollow sphere, inside we will trap a small ball. 
We can shake the sphere and the ball will start to move around.  
We assume the sphere is under the influence of a significant gravitational field (ex: Here at Havana), and there is friction between the sphere walls and the ball. 

Now lets try to answer two questions

**i.  What is the full trajectory that the ball will follow inside the sphere?**

For aswering we will need:
- the precise geometric shape of the ball and the sphere
- the mass of the ball
- the precise position and initial velocity of the ball
- A detailed dynamic description of the force applied to the sphere (the shaking)
- A  detailed description of the friction between the ball and the sphere
- etc

This is a lot of data. For all possible initial conditions, we will typically have a very different trajectory of the ball. Small errors can change significantly the trajectory. If we change any parameter, like the mass of the ball, we need to start over.

**ii. What is the final position of the ball?**
For this we only need to examine the dynamic at the limit $t \to \infty$
In this case it is simple: 
- The shaking give the interior ball energy.
- The ball will be jumping around
- As soon as we stop shaking, the ball will be only loosing  energy doe to friction
- This process will continue till the possible minimum of energy for the ball is achieved
- This minimum is reached we the ball has zero kinetic energy and the lowest potential energy.
- The lowest potential energy occurs at the bottom of the sphere.
- This position will be stable on time (it is the [[equilibrium]])

As you can see, this answer does not depend (except special cases, ex: very large friction) on any particular property, nor geometrical nor physical, of the sphere or the ball. It is not affected by initial conditions. Also, it does not depend on the shaking process, nor the friction process. This is equivalent to say: "The ball will be in the bottom no matter what is the initial context". There are many trajectories with the same final position, in this case, all trajectories have the same equilibrium position. 



> #ISSUE/IDEA/GAME
> For illustrating this, a game can be set to try to predict both stuff, trajectories vs equilibrium position
> - The players can draw the predicted trajectory and the final position 
> - The parameters of the game can be randomly chosen and displayed to the players
