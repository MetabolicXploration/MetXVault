In [[linear algebra]], the adjugate or classical adjoint of a square matrix $A$, $adj(A)$, is the transpose of its cofactor matrix. It is occasionally known as adjunct matrix, or "adjoint", though that normally refers to a different concept, the adjoint operator which for a matrix is the conjugate transpose.
The product of a matrix with its adjugate gives a diagonal matrix (entries not on the main diagonal are zero) whose diagonal entries are the determinant of the original matrix:

  $$\mathbf {A} \operatorname {adj} (\mathbf {A} )=\det(\mathbf {A} )\mathbf {I}$$
  
where I is the identity matrix of the same size as A. Consequently, the multiplicative inverse of an invertible matrix can be found by dividing its adjugate by its determinant.
