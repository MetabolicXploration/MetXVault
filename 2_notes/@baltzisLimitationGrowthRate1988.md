### Abstract:
Abstract Experimental data in the literature show that the yield of biomass from a particular nutrient when that nutrient limits growth rate is often significantly different than the yield from the nutrient when some complementary nutrient limits growth rate. This article explores some possible consequences for bioreactor dynamics of dependence of yield coefficients on the identity of the nutrient that limits growth rate.
