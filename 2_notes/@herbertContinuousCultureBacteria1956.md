### Abstract:
SUMMARY: A theoretical treatment of [[Continuous Culture]]s is given, which allows quantitative prediction of the [[Steady-State]] concentrations of bacteria and substrate in the culture, and how these may be expected to vary with change of medium, concentration and flow-rate. The layout and operation of a small pilot plant for the continuous culture of bacteria are described. This plant has been operated continuously for periods of up to 4 months without breakdown or contamination of the culture. No alterations in the properties of the organisms studied have occurred during such periods of continuous culture. Results are given of a series of experiments on the continuous culture of Aerobacter cloacae in a chemically defined medium, designed to allow quantitative comparison with the results predicted by the theory. The relative advantages of batch and continuous culture as production processes are discussed, and it is concluded that continuous culture may usually be expected to show a five to tenfold increase in output as compared with a batch process.,

> **#Figure. 4**. Growth curves of Aerobacter cloacae in batch culture. Details of growth conditions and culture medium are given in the text. Curve (a)was obtained from a seed culture at the start of a continuous culture run; curve (b) was obtained after the culture had been operated continuously for 6 weeks (the points on curve (b) have been displaced 2 hr. to the right to avoid overlapping with curve (a)). 
> **#Figure. 5**. Steady states in continuous culture. Aerobacter cloacae was grown in continuous culture as described in the text ;the data plotted are hourly measurements of bacterial concentration atthree different flow-rates. The continuous lines are the lines of best fit, calculated statistically; the dotted lines are the 95 yo fiducial limits.

> **#Figure. 6**. Quantitative relationships in continuous culture of Aerobacter cloacae; comparison of experiment with theory. The data of Table 1 are plotted for comparison with the theoretical relationships calculated from equations (9) and (10). The continuous lines are the theoretical curves; the dotted lines are drawn to fit the experimental points.
