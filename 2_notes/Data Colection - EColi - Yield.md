Yield is reported for different nutrients and is contrasted between wild, evolved and KOs strain. 

#TODO 
Check supplementary materials

- The experimental setup is great. 
- They can control the nutrient input. 
- I need to read and understand better the paper. 

#DATA/NOTES
- The main body of data are figures. Including supplementary materials.
