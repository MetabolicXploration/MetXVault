### Abstract:
A significant goal in the post-genome era is to relate the annotated genome sequence to the physiological functions of a cell. Working from the annotated genome sequence, as well as biochemical and physiological information, it is possible to reconstruct complete metabolic networks. Furthermore, computational methods have been developed to interpret and predict the optimal performance of a metabolic network under a range of growth conditions. We have tested the hypothesis that [[Escherichia coli]] uses its metabolism to grow at a maximal rate using the [[Escherichia coli-MG1655|E. coli MG1655]] metabolic reconstruction. Based on this hypothesis, we formulated experiments that describe the quantitative relationship between a primary carbon source (acetate or succinate) uptake rate, oxygen uptake rate, and maximal cellular growth rate. We found that the experimental data were consistent with the stated hypothesis, namely that the E. coli metabolic network is optimized to maximize growth under the experimental conditions considered. This study thus demonstrates how the combination of in silico and experimental biology can be used to obtain a quantitative genotype-phenotype relationship for metabolism in bacterial cells.

#Figure 2. In silico predictions of growth and metabolic functions and comparisons to experimental data. (A) The acetate uptake rate (AUR) (mmol/g DW/h) versus oxygen uptake rate (OUR)(mmol/g DW/h) phenotype phase plane. Red line is the in silico-defined line of optimality (LO). The slope of this line is indicated in the figure. The experimental data points are displayed on the figure. The error bars represent a single standard deviation, and the error bars are displayed for both the AUR and the OUR measurements. A linear regression was performed (the dashed line) on the data points to define the experimentally reconstructed LO. The R2 value for the curve fit is 0.92. Regions 1 and 2 represent nonoptimal metabolic phenotypes. (B) The three-dimensional rendering of the phase surface. The x- and y-axis represent the same variables as in (A). The third dimension represents the cellular growth rate. The z-axis values are color-coded with the optimal growth rate value quantitatively indicated on the corresponding legend. The LO in three dimensions is indicated. The parametric equation of LO in three dimensions is indicated in the text. The black lines define the surface of the metabolic capabilities in the three-dimensional projection of the flux cone and represent constant values of the AUR or OUR. The quantitative effect on cellular growth potential of increasing the AUR (without proportional increase in the OUR) can be visualized. The data points (in blue) are also plotted on the three-dimensional figure and error bars have been omitted.

#Figure 4. In silico predictions of growth and metabolic functions and comparisons to experimental data. (A) The succinate uptake rate (SUR) (mmol/g DW/h) versus oxygen uptake rate (OUR) (mmol/g DW/h) phenotype phase plane. Red line is the in silico-defined line of optimality (LO). The experimental data points are displayed on the figure. The error bars are displayed for both the SUR and OUR measurements and represent a single standard deviation. Cultivations for which acetate was produced above a threshold of 0.3 mmol/g DW/h are indicated by open circles; filled circles identify either no acetate production or production below the threshold. The black dotted line represents the linear regression of the data points with no acetate production. (C) Three-dimensional phenotype phase surface analysis. The x- and y-axis represent the same variables as in (A). The third dimension represents the cellular growth rate. The z-axis values are color-coded with the corresponding legend in the figure. The demarcation lines separating the colored regions represent constant OURs and AURs, and the quantitative effect of moving away from the LO can be visualized. The data points are plotted in this three-dimensional figure with the exception of the error bars.
