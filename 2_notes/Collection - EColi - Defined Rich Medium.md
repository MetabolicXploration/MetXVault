## Abstract

This collection must contain papers with studies made on E. coli in defined rich mediums.

## Papers

### [[@maserAvoidingAminoAcid2019]]

- The experiments showed sequential (but also simultaneous) consumption of amino acids.
- The yield (in time) for each aminoacid can be computed.
- They noticed that depending on the medium composition, the growth of E. coli continuous or not. A discontinuity meaning that there is a lag phase before restarting. 
	- This phase change points are linked to nutrient depletion. 
- #ResearchQuestion 
	- Are the yields for each nutrient close to the optimum?
	- Can we reproduce the consumption patterns for each medium?
		- nutrient yields?
		- yield change after some nutrients are depleted?
