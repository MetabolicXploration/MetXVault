## Announcement

- TITLE: **Successful modeling of bacterial physiology: what it feels like.** 
- SPEAKER: José Antonio Pereiro Morejón

- ABSTRACT: Studying bacterial culture physiology is an active field in life sciences for more than a century. A isogenic culture of bacteria in a well define laboratory environment might sound as a simple system as compared with the human gut for instance; and the comparison is fair. A problem in biology is that even the simplest real system are difficult to model succesfully. In this talk we will discuss about the wins and fails of several attempts to model bacterial culture physiology. Why it is so difficult, and what are some potential future path fowards. To please the audience, we will try to make as many analogies as possible with the stodying of physical systems and it history.
