An interesting fact about bees is that they play a crucial role in pollination, with nearly 90% of wild plants and 75% of leading global crops depending on animal pollination. This means that one out of every three bites of food we consume relies on the work of pollinators like bees. Additionally, crops that require pollination are valued at five times more than those that do not, highlighting the economic importance of these insects in agriculture and food production
