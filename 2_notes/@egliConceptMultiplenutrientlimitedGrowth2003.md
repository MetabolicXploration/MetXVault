### Abstract:
The "law of the minimum" (Liebig's law) states that usually one nutrient restricts the maximum quantity of biomass that can be produced within a system, whereas all other nutrients are in excess. This general rule has been applied also to the growth of microorganisms, e.g., by adjusting the relative concentrations of the individual nutrients in growth media such that one of them, in the case of heterotrophic microbes, usually the carbon source, determines the maximum cell density that can be obtained in a culture. However, experimental data demonstrated that growth of microbial cultures can be limited simultaneously by two or more nutrients. These authors reported that during growth of bacteria and yeasts at a constant dilution rate in the chemostat, three distinct growth regimes were recognised as a function of the C:N ratio in the inflowing medium: (1) a clearly carbon-limited regime with the nitrogen source in excess, (2) a transition ("double-nutrient-limited") growth regime where both the carbon and the nitrogen source were below the detection limit, and (3) a clearly nitrogen-limited growth regime with the carbon source in excess. Subsequent calculations suggested that the extension and position of this double-nutrient-limited zone should be strongly dependent on the imposed growth rate: Whereas it is very narrow at high growth rates it should become very broad during slow growth. This pattern as a function of growth rate has now been confirmed for a number of different organisms. In industrial processes, microbial growth is always in some way controlled by the limited availability of nutrients, and limitation of specific nutrients is frequently used to force microbial cultures into a productive physiological state. This article will discuss what the consequences of multiple-nutrient-limited growth are for industrial processes and how the concept might be applied. Specific examples will be given that demonstrate the advantages and the potential of multiple nutrient-limited growth conditions for industrial production processes.

#Question How can we explain a region of multi-limiting nutrients?

Is this a limitation of the shadow price #Project/NutrientLimitation 


## 1. Introduction

Cultivation conditions strongly influence the cellular composition and metabolic performance of microbial cells. Herbert (1961) summarised this in the early 60s in this way: ‘‘There are few characteristics of microorganisms which are so directly and markedly affected by the environment as their chemical composition. So much is this the case that it is virtually meaningless to speak of the chemical composition of a microorganism without at the same time specifying the environmental conditions that produced it.’’ #Insight 

Media used for controlled cultivation of microbial cultures are usually designed such that one particular nutrient restricts (‘‘limits’’) the maximum quantity of biomass that can be produced, whereas all other nutrients are available in excess. The design of growth media is based on the ‘‘[[law of the minimum]]’’ proposed by Justus von Liebig around 1840 (von Liebig, 1843). Based on this principle, it is assumed in microbiology that it is always one particular nutrient that determines the maximum amount of biomass that can be produced in defined growth medium. However, there are many experimental studies in the literature indicating that in contrast to Liebig’s principle, growth of microbial cultures can be limited by two or even more nutrients simultaneously. #Insight #NutrientLimitation

It should be mentioned at this point that in microbiology the term ‘‘limitation of growth’’ is used in two different ways. On one hand it is employed in a stoichiometric sense; that is, it indicates that a certain amount of biomass is synthesised from a particular nutrient (or element). This is reflected in the growth yield constants for the different elements, which are documented in the literature (e.g., Pirt, 1975). #Reference #Insight #NutrientLimitation

On the other hand, this expression is also used to indicate that the microbial specific rate of growth, l, is controlled by the extracellular concentration (s) of a particular growth substrate, as described, for example, by the equation $\mu = \mu_{max} s / (K_s + s)$ proposed by [[Monod]] (1942). The present discussion is limited to the former, the stoichiometric concept of limitation. #Insight #NutrientLimitation

## 2. The phenomenon

Already in the 70s a number of experimental reports were available which indicated that growth of microbial cultures may be simultaneously limited by two or more nutrients (Harrison, 1972; Cooney et al., 1976; Hueting and Tempest, 1979). Clear experimental evidence for this was then provided in the 80s for both bacterial and yeast cultures (Egli, 1982; Egli and Quayle, 1986; Gra¨zer-Lampert et al., 1986; Minkevich et al., 1988; Duchars and Attwood, 1989; Rutgers et al., 1990). An example for the observations reported by all these researchers is given in Fig. 1 for growth of a bacterium in chemostat culture at a constant dilution rate fed with media of different C:N ratios (Grazer-Lampert et al., 1986). The data indicate, based on the levels of residual carbon and nitrogen sources and the cellular composition, three distinct zones of growth:

1. A carbon-limited growth regime with nitrogen in excess at C/N < 7.1, 
2. A nitrogen-limited growth regime with carbon in excess at C/N>12.6, and 
3. A transition zone with neither carbon nor nitrogen in excess at C/N medium feed ratios 7.1 < C/N < 12.6.

Note that in this experiment the concentration of nitrogen in the feed medium $s_{0N} = 223~mg~L^{-1}$ was kept constant whereas $s_{0C}$ (methanol) was increased stepwise.

## 4. The dual-nutrient-limited zone of growth at different growth rates

The fact that the boundaries of nutrient-limited zones of growth can be derived simply from the growth yields allowed the prediction of the position and extension of the zone of glycerol/ammonia-limited growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae from literature data (Egli, 1991). The results obtained are shown in Fig. 2; they illustrate that the extension of the carbon/nitrogen-limited zone depends strongly on the growth rate of the culture. At specific growth rates close to lmax, the zone is predicted to be very narrow. However, during growth at low dilution rates a rather extended zone of simultaneously carbon/ nitrogen-limited growth should be observed, and, at the same time, the zone should shift to higher c0/n0 feed ratios (mainly due to increased maintenance energy requirements resulting in lower yields for carbon). An important consequence of this behaviour would be that cultivation of K. pneumoniae with a medium of a c0/n0 ratio of 8 would result in carbon-limited growth at low dilution rates, whereas with the same medium, growth should become nitrogen-limited at higher dilution rates.

The existence of dual-nutrient-limited transition zones between single-nutrient-limited growth regimes has recently been confirmed for a number of different nutrient combinations and microorganisms, including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and yeasts (Al-Awadhi et al., 1990; Bonting et al., 1992; Durner et al., 2000; Egli and Quayle, 1986; Frank, 1999; Hao and Chang, 1987; Lucca et al., 1991; Pengerud et al., 1987; Pin˜ar et al., 1998; von Stockar et al., 1995). However, the information is limited in most cases to one particular growth rate, and we are only aware of two reports where the extension and position of the transition zone has been investigated in dependence of the growth rate (Minkevich et al., 1988; Durner et al., 2000). #Project/PaperSON
