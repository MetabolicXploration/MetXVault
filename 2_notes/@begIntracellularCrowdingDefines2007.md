### Abstract:
The influence of the high intracellular concentration of macromolecules on cell physiology is increasingly appreciated, but its impact on system-level cellular functions remains poorly quantified. To assess its potential effect, here we develop a flux balance model of Escherichia coli cell metabolism that takes into account a systems-level constraint for the concentration of enzymes catalyzing the various metabolic reactions in the crowded cytoplasm. We demonstrate that the model's predictions for the relative maximum growth rate of wild-type and mutant E. coli cells in single substrate-limited media, and the sequence and mode of substrate uptake and utilization from a complex medium are in good agreement with subsequent experimental observations. These results suggest that molecular crowding represents a bound on the achievable functional states of a metabolic network, and they indicate that models incorporating this constraint can systematically identify alterations in cellular metabolism activated in response to environmental change.

#Figure (b) The measured concentration of the indicated carbon sources in the growth medium. The growth experiments were performed in triplicate (SI Fig. 8), and means and standard deviations are shown here. The three substrate utilization phases, phase 1 (exclusive glucose), phase 2 (mixed substrates), and phase 3 (glycerol and acetate), are indicated in light blue, purple, and white backgrounds, respectively. (c) Predicted substrate uptakes from the growth medium based on the [[FBAwMC]] model. The color coding for substrate utilization curves is identical in b and c, and the error bars represent the standard deviations of the data analyzed from the samples collected from three individual bioreactor runs (SI Fig. 8).
