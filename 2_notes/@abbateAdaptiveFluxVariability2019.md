### Abstract:
Underdetermined metabolic networks are usually investigated using Flux Variability Analysis (FVA) under the pseudo-steady state assumption of the internal metabolites. When a dynamic overview of the flux map is sought, the time variation of the cell uptake and excretion rates is deduced from extracellular dynamic mass balances and smoothing of the measurement data of the time evolution of the extracellular concentrations. Nevertheless, the resulting system of equations does not always admit a feasible solution under these constraints. Indeed, measurement data is affected by noise, whose processing (smoothing, etc) always entails some subjective user choices, and the network itself might not be perfectly suited to explain the several culture phases. To alleviate these adverse effects, the constraints can be relaxed by introducing coefficients of variation of the external fluxes, and by considering an interval representation of the fluxes. This work presents a systematic method to determine these coefficients of variation, along the time course of the culture, leading to an adaptive scheme where the coefficients are set to the tightest bounds. The methodology is applied to experimental data of cultures of hybridoma in batch and perfusion modes and compared to previously published results.
