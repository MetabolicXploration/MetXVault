 #NOTE A symmetric distribution might be interpreted as an evidence that there is no differential bias toward extremes... for example, if the distribution of enzymatic efficiency is symmetric, the hypothesis of evolutionary pressure toward high efficiency is not supported.   Could this be apply on [[MaxEnt]] distributions?
