### Abstract:
The metabolism of a bacterial cell stretches beyond its boundaries, often connecting with the metabolism of other cells to form extended metabolic networks that stretch across communities, and even the globe. Among the least intuitive metabolic connections are those involving cross-feeding of canonically intracellular metabolites. How and why are these intracellular metabolites externalized? Are bacteria simply leaky? Here I consider what it means for a bacterium to be leaky, and I review mechanisms of metabolite externalization from the context of cross-feeding. Despite common claims, diffusion of most intracellular metabolites across a membrane is unlikely. Instead, passive and active transporters are likely involved, possibly purging excess metabolites as part of homeostasis. Re-acquisition of metabolites by a producer limits the opportunities for cross-feeding. However, a competitive recipient can stimulate metabolite externalization and initiate a positive-feedback loop of reciprocal cross-feeding.
