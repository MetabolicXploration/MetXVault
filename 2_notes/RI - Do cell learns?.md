### Do cell learns?

- If we take a [[Chemostat]] and make pulses of nutrients. For instance, We can oscillate between a medium with one aminoacid supplement and no supplement. 
- Let assumes the cells reacts somehow.
- After a while, we can cut the oscillation in the medium. 
- If the cells stop, that suggest that they where only reacting to the environment. 
- But if they keep oscillating without the stimulus, that suggest they have some internal memory.
- The internal memory can also be tested by having gaps on the nutrient oscillations, and comparing if the reaction changes compared with the initial reaction of an unexposed cells.  
- We can play with the gap width and see how far the memory goes. 
- As well as play with the amplitude of the oscillations.
