### Abstract:
The phenotype of an individual microbial cell is not determined by genes and environment alone. Rather, a number of cellular mechanisms produce phenotypic differences between genetically identical cells grown in homogeneous environments; these differences are referred to as phenotypic heterogeneity.The degree of heterogeneity that arises in a given trait is influenced by the biochemical properties of molecules and by the architecture of gene-regulatory networks. Mutations and other genetic changes can therefore influence the degree of phenotypic heterogeneity.As a consequence, phenotypic heterogeneity is an evolvable trait that can be shaped by natural selection. Increased levels of heterogeneity in specific phenotypic traits can evolve if this provides organisms with benefits in terms of increased survival and growth.One possible benefit is that phenotypic heterogeneity can help organisms to cope with fluctuating environments. This effect is known as bet hedging.Another possible benefit arises through division of labour. Individual cells with different phenotypic traits can specialize in different activities and behaviours and can engage in beneficial interactions.Phenotypic heterogeneity is a potentially important component of biological diversity; it arises at the level of individual microbial cells and provides groups of microorganisms with added functionality.
