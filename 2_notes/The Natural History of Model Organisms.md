Many of the fundamental principles of biology were discovered in model organisms, but there is still a lot to learn about their life and biology "in the wild". The articles in this collection explore what is known about the natural history of a range of model organisms, and explain how studying these organisms in their natural habitats could lead to breakthroughs in many different areas of biology.
