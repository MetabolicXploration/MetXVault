The **molar gas constant** (also known simply as the gas constant) is the molar equivalent to the [[Boltzmann constant]], expressed in units of energy per [[temperature]] increment per amount of substance (quantified in moles rather than single particles). Its value is about $8.31~J·K^{−1}·mol^{−1}$
