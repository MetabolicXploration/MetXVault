This challenge the **optimality argument** with respect to enzymatic allocation. A fraction of 15% is might not be that important. On top, there are also a distribution of uses in the large metabolic network... So, optimizing the top 10 most used enzymes should probably account for a large fraction of that not that large fraction of the proteome... At least in non spetial case.
