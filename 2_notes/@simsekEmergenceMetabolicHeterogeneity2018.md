### Abstract:
Abstract Microorganisms adapt to frequent environmental changes through population diversification. Previous studies demonstrated phenotypic diversity in a clonal population and its important effects on microbial ecology. However, the dynamic changes of phenotypic composition have rarely been characterized. Also, cellular variations and environmental factors responsible for phenotypic diversity remain poorly understood. Here, we studied phenotypic diversity driven by metabolic heterogeneity. We characterized metabolic activities and growth kinetics of starved Escherichia coli cells subject to nutrient upshift at single-cell resolution. We observed three subpopulations with distinct metabolic activities and growth phenotypes. One subpopulation was metabolically active and immediately grew upon nutrient upshift. One subpopulation was metabolically inactive and non-viable. The other subpopulation was metabolically partially active, and did not grow upon nutrient upshift. The ratio of these subpopulations changed dynamically during starvation. A long-term observation of cells with partial metabolic activities indicated that their metabolism was later spontaneously restored, leading to growth recovery. Further investigations showed that oxidative stress can induce the emergence of a subpopulation with partial metabolic activities. Our findings reveal the emergence of metabolic heterogeneity and associated dynamic changes in phenotypic composition. In addition, the results shed new light on microbial dormancy, which has important implications in microbial ecology and biomedicine.
