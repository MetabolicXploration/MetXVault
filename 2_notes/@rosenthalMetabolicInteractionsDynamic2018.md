### Abstract:
Individual microbial species are known to occupy distinct metabolic niches within multi-species communities. However, it has remained largely unclear whether metabolic specialization can similarly occur within a clonal bacterial population. More specifically, it is not clear what functions such specialization could provide and how specialization could be coordinated dynamically. Here, we show that exponentially growing Bacillus subtilis cultures divide into distinct interacting metabolic subpopulations, including one population that produces acetate, and another population that differentially expresses metabolic genes for the production of acetoin, a pH-neutral storage molecule. These subpopulations exhibit distinct growth rates and dynamic interconversion between states. Furthermore, acetate concentration influences the relative sizes of the different subpopulations. These results show that clonal populations can use metabolic specialization to control the environment through a process of dynamic, environmentally-sensitive state-switching. , The chemical reactions that occur within a living organism are collectively referred to as its metabolism. Many metabolic reactions produce byproducts that will poison the cells if they are not dealt with: fermenting bacteria, for example, release harmful organic acids and alcohols. How the bacteria respond to these toxins has been most studied at the level of entire microbial populations, meaning the activities of individual cells are effectively “averaged” together. Yet, even two bacteria with the same genes and living in the same environment can behave in different ways. This raises the question: do bacterial populations specialize into distinct subpopulations that play distinct roles when dealing with metabolic products, or do all cells in the community act in unison? Rosenthal et al. set out to answer this question for a community of Bacillus subtilis, a bacterium that is commonly studied in the laboratory and used for the industrial production of enzymes. The analysis focused on genes involved in fundamental metabolic processes, known as the TCA cycle, which the bacteria use to generate energy and build biomass. The experiments revealed that, even when all the cells are genetically identical, different Bacillus subtilis cells do indeed specialize into metabolic subpopulations with distinct growth rates. Time-lapse movies of bacteria that made fluorescent markers of different colors whenever certain metabolic genes became active showed cells switching different colors on and off, indicating that they switch between metabolic subpopulations. Further biochemical studies and measures of gene activity revealed that the different subpopulations produce and release distinct metabolic products, including toxic byproducts. Notably, the release of these metabolites by one subpopulation appeared to activate other subpopulations within the community. This example of cells specializing into unique interacting metabolic subpopulations provides insight into several fundamental issues in microbiology and beyond. It is relevant to evolutionary biologists, since the fact that fractions of the population can switch in and out of a metabolic state, instead of evolving into several inflexible specialists, may provide an evolutionary advantage in fluctuating natural environments by reducing the risk of extinction. It also has implications for industrial fermentation processes and metabolic engineering, and may help biotechnologists design more efficient ways to harness bacterial metabolism to produce useful products.
