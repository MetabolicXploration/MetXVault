> - Custom/general constraints
> 	- The case of [[Nutrient Limitation]]
> 		- [[Shadow Price]] 
> 			- In FBA framework, a limited nutrient is just the nutrient which bound is an effective constraint
> 		- Validation #bottleneck
> 			- Given that we have a model (a constrained sub ensemble), check that it represent data better.
> - Hit and Down
> - Redundant/Essential/Common Nutrients 
> 	- In FBA framework a nutrient is limited if it is solving a unique 'role' on the objective (biomass) optimization.
> 	- That is, the [[FBA]] framework force us to explore the bound space (the polytope space)
> 		- For instance, defining nutrient limitation this on [[MaxEnt]] framework is harder
> 			- I did some work with [[Andrea Pagnani]]
> 				- #TODO Link notes/sources
> - Sequencial contextualization
> 	- For instance, reaction to nutrient composition in a [[Chemostat]]
> 		- You can theoretical compute how informative this strategy can be

> - Explore the phenotypic spanned space by sampling the GPR network
> 	- Compare it with the phenotypic spanned space from regulating directly the reactions. 
>  - We are exploring how efficiently the phenotypic space can be explored by only on/off regulation strategies.
