#ToCheck 

- Are we including in the EP model from [[@pereiro-morejonInferenceMetabolicFluxes2022]] the full constraints given by the steady state of a chemostat?
- I mean, the chemostat in squeezing the noise to the minimum.
- Maybe we can add all possibles chemostat dynamics using Matias path integrals.
