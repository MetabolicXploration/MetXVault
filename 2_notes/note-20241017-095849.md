That is, the cells are two levels (at least) exponential replicators. Ribosomes (the base) produces proteins (including Ribosome's owns) linearly. Then, the Ribosome population grow exponentially till division. Then, the population of cells grow exponentially as well.

Note that you can have a population level grow without the exponential single cell biomass grow.
