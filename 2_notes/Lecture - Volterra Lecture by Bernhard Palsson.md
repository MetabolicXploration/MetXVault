## Notes

- [[Host Factor]]: The properties of a metabolic pathway that can not be fully explain by looking the pathway in isolation, but needs to insert it in the context of the full network. 

- In an study on [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] (see [[@monkGenomescaleMetabolicReconstructions2013|here]]), mapping genomes into metabolic networks, it was found that a lot of the variation was in the catabolic/transport part of the network.
