### Abstract:

The amino acid composition of proteins and the fatty acid composition of the cell membranes were measured in Escherichia coli growing exponentially in batch culture on glucose, succinate, glycerol, pyruvate, and acetate, and growing under continuous culture conditions on glucose at dilutions rates equivalent to the growth rates of the batch cultures. Although the fatty acid composition of the membranes did change significantly with carbon source and dilution rate, the amino acid content of proteins did not change significantly under either condition. A previously developed stoichiometric model of metabolism was used to calculate the fluxes through the metabolic reactions and to determine their sensitivity to changes in fatty acid and amino acid composition.
