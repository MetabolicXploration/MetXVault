## Introduction

Bacteria grown on multiple carbon substrates often consume them sequentially, using some only after others are depleted [1,2] . This ‘hierarchical’ order of utilization has been studied most intensely in Escherichia coli [1,3–5] , particularly through the iconic diauxic growth on lactose and glucose [6, 7] . #Project/PaperSON [[Data Collection - EColi - Physiology]]

However, several studies have demonstrated that mixtures of carbon substrates that are utilized hierarchically in batch cultures are utilized simultaneously in carbon-limited chemostat cultures [8–10]. #Project/PaperSON [[Data Collection - EColi - Physiology]]

Similarly, if multiple substrates are present at low concentrations, they are often utilized simultaneously even in batch culture [8,11–13]. #Project/PaperSON [[Data Collection - EColi - Physiology]]

Intriguingly, hierarchical utilization appears to be limited to combinations of glycolytic substrates: gluconeogenic substrates tend to be co-utilized with other substrates [14] #Project/PaperSON [[Data Collection - EColi - Physiology]]


## Results

### Patterns of hierarchical and simultaneous utilization. 

#### Titratable uptake of the preferred substrate

Since its discovery, diauxic growth has been used as the primary way to study hierarchy in carbon-substrate utilization [1] . However, to elucidate the mechanisms involved, it is necessary to study the regime where the preferred substrate is running out and the cell begins to metabolize the second substrate. The transient nature of this ‘[[diauxic shift]]’ makes a quantitative characterization difficult to perform. Here, we exploit strains that allow the cellular response to the depletion of the preferred substrate to be studied in batch cultures under balanced exponential growth. Because maintaining fixed low substrate concentrations during exponential growth is difficult, we used E. coli strains in which the expression of a substrate-uptake system—and hence the uptake flux of that substrate—can be controlled by varying the concentration of an inducer (3-methylbenzyl alcohol, 3MBA) in the growth medium (Fig. 1c) [16]. Thus, we mimicked the reduced uptake flux of the preferred substrate when it runs out, while keeping its actual concentration at saturating levels. #CoolExperiment 

#### FBP senses upper-glycolytic flux and directly inhibits glycerol uptake.

A recent study reported that the intracellular FBP pool increases linearly with the glycolytic flux and hence called FBP a glycolytic flux sensor [21]. #Insight
