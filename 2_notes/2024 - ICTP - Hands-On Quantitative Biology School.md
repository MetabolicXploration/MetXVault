## ReadingList 1

From the school program

> #NOTE
> We can start by the **speakers**:
> - [[Marco Cosentino]]
> - [[Jacopo Grilli]]
> - [[Gabriele Micali]]
> - [[Alexander P Petroff]]
> - [[William R. Shoemaker]]
> - [[Giorgio Tallarico]]
> - L.F. TOLEDO, Unicamp, Brazil

## ReadingList 2

This is the product of the exchange with professors in the school and by mail.

> 	 - A surface-reading allow you to evaluate the paper/book to aid prioritization

> ### From [[Jacopo Grilli]]
>
> Regarding the first question (author/paper/etc suggestions).
> 
> -  On quantitative ecology, there are many recent works worth to mention, but my suggestion is to explore the recent works of the following people: [[Alvaro Sanchez]], [[Otto Cordero]], [[Jeff Gore]], [[Martina Dal Bello]], [[Aksihit Goyal]], [[Seppe Kuhen]], [[Martin Ackermann]], [[Sara Mitri]] (my opinion is that the field is still lacking a strong connection between experiments and theory... and I see this as an opportunity, not a critique) 
> - On quantitative physiology (excluding cell size control): [[Terence Hwa]], [[Jonas Cremer]], [[Marcus Basan]], [[Marco Cosentino|Marco Cosentino Lagomarsino]]
>
>
> Regarding the second question (about [[ICTP - Evolution and Ecology - Course]])
> 
> do not have readable notes, but for the ecology side I mostly followed the book by [[@strogatzNonlinearDynamicsChaos2015|Strogatz (non-linear dynamics and chaos)]] and [[@murrayMathematicalBiology2002|“Mathematical Biology vol i” by Murray]]...

***
> ### From [[Gabriele Micali]]
> 
> I try to add a few names to the one that Jacopo already mentioned that work specifically
> on e. coli cross-feeding with amino acids.
> 
> [[Christian Kost]]  is one of the leading groups studying auxotrophies and interactions among them. His group was among the first to approach the auxotrophies in an experimental setting to prove the [[Black Queen Hypothesis]]. He is an ecologist, the work is very cool but very quantitative.
> 
> This paper [[@meeSyntrophicExchangeSynthetic2014]] was coming out approximately when also [[Christian Kost]] group was starting the **auxotrophy** work ([[2014]]). It has the merit of systematically comparing amino acid cross-feeding in [[E. coli]] mutants but I have a lot of problems in the ways they quantify growth and model the cross-feeding.
> 
> [[William Harcombe]] has developed a synthetic system in which Dmet [[E. coli]] cross-feed with Salmonella in Lactose media and has several publications about this system. This system was used by [[Daniel Segrè]] to develop some Flux Balance ecological models ([[COMETS]] if I am not mistaken was the software they developed).
> 
> 
> [[Alma Dal Co]], [[Simon van Vliet]], and [[Daan Kiviet]] (former [[Martin Ackermann]] group) and in parallel [[Ophelia Venturelli]] group developed [[microfluidics]] for imaging cross-feeding [[E. coli]] at the single cell level (publications in 2020): 
> - [[@guptaInvestigatingDynamicsMicrobial2020]]
> - [[@dalcoShortrangeInteractionsGovern2020]]
> 
> Alma, Simon, Ophelia, and I have been working on those systems since then.
> 
> If something else comes to my mind I will let you know. If you want to discuss some of
> these papers let me know.

> - Ross et al [[@rossMetabolicInterplayDrives2024|recently]] (see also [[@rossSupplementaryMaterialsMetabolic2024|supp materials]]) released a preprint demonstrating oscillatory dynamics in a [[chemostat]] at steady-state. They do not go much into the quantitative physiology underlying the excretion and I think that could be an interesting angle. #ResearchIdea 
> 
> - I based part of my lecture on the model from [[@vetMutualisticCrossfeedingMicrobial2020|Vet et al]] (see also [[vetSupplementaryMaterialsMutualistic2020|supp materials]]). The full model has the phenomenon of an [[Allee effect]] (sign of per-capita growth rate being density-dependent) which could theoretically be tested in a chemostat by lowering the concentration of carbon concentration in the supplied media. #ResearchIdea 
> 
> - [[Jake McKinlay]] works on cross-feeding, though often one member is a photosynthetic autotroph. He recently published an [[@mckinlayAreBacteriaLeaky2023|article]] asking about the permeability of metabolites and how they relate to the requirements of cells. The relationship between excretion rates vs. cell demands still seems largely unexplored for cross-feeding, at least empirically. #ResearchIdea
