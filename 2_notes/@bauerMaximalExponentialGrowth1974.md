### Abstract:
Abstract Oxygen supply is one of the main factors which influences aerobic cell growth in a fermentor. Maximal rates at which E. coli can grow on glucose as carbon source under various limiting oxygen‐supply conditions were determined in a bench‐scale fermentor. Culture conditions are described which gave yields of about 38 g dry cells per liter medium.
