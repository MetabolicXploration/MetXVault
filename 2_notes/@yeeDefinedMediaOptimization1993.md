### Abstract:
Abstract An optimized, defined minimal medium was developed to support balanced growth of Escherichia coli X90 harboring a recombinant plasmid. Foreign protein expression was repressed in these studies. A pulse injection technique was used to identify the growth responses to nutrients in a chemostat. Once the nutrients essential for growth had been identified, the yield coefficients for individual medium components. These yield coefficients were used to develop an optimized, **glucose‐limited defined minimal** medium that supports balanced cell growth in chemostat culture. The biomass and substrate concentrations follow the Monod chemostat model. The maximum specific growth rate determined in a washout experiment is 0.87 h −1 for this strain in the optimized medium. the glucose yield factor is 0.42 g DCW/g glucose and the maintenance coefficient is zero in the glucose‐limited chemostat culture. © 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Metabolic Perturbations in a CHemostat

## Analytical Procedures

One optical density unit was found to be equal to 0.43 g dry cell weight (DCW)/L. #BioNumber #OpticalDensity

## Pulse Injection Procedures

## Determination of Yield Coefficients

First, a glucose limited chemostat was established and steady-state samples were taken after 10 residence times. The concentration of the limiting nutrient in the feed was lowered until a residual glucose concentration could be detected in the effluent. #Insight #NutrientLimited 

## Glucose-Limited Chemostat

The maximum specific growth rate was calculated to be 0.87 $h^{-1}$

The medium was then changed to MM3X and steadystate samples were taken for decreasing dilution rates. The increased macronutrient concentration had no effect on the steady-state biomass or substrate concentration, indicating that a two-fold excess was adequate to avoid any other nutrient limitation. Moreover, no hysteresis effect was observed upon increasing or decreasing the dilution rate.

The X-D diagram is shown in Figure 6 together with the substrate and acetate concentration in the steadystate samples. The acetate concentration was below the detectable limit until the maximum specific growth rate was approached. The cell density and glucose concentration remain constant over the entire growth rate range and follow the Monod chemostat model for a singlesubstrate-limited chemostat, and suggests that the medium provides balanced growth over the growth-rate range of this strain.

#AcetateSwitch


## Discussion

A solution of the macronutrient salts was then injected and an increased optical density of 0.7 OD units was detected. The biomass concentration then returned to its original steady-state value as the pulse was washed out after 8 hours. This suggested that one or more of the nutrients in the salt solution were limiting the growth. #NutrientLimited #Insight #Definition

It was confirmed that nitrogen was the limiting nutrient when the injection of a two-fold amount of NH4CI resulted in a two-fold increase in biomass concentration relative to the macronutrient salt solution. It has been reported that ammonia is the preferred nitrogen source for growth of E. coli on minimal media with glucose as the carbon source.21 Thus, it is not surprising that the injection of NH4Cl as a nitrogen source alleviated the nitrogen limitation, whereas the injection of amino acids as organic nitrogen sources did not.

The **phosphorus yield** of 34 g DCW/g P that we obtained is comparable with the yield of 36 g DCW/g P reported by Reiling et al [20] who used a similar technique to determine yield factors for E. coli B/r. #BioNumber #Yield
