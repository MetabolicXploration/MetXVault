### Abstract:
Luria-Bertani broth supports Escherichia coli growth to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 7. Surprisingly, however, steady-state growth ceases at an OD600 of 0.3, when the growth rate slows down and cell mass decreases. Growth stops for lack ...

> #Figure 1: Growth of [[E. coli]] [[MG1655]] in [[Luria-Bertani]] broth. An overnight culture was diluted 5,000-fold in Luria-Bertani broth and cultivated at 37°C with vigorous aeration. (A) The $OD_{600}$ (triangles) and cell concentration (crosses) were measured periodically. (B) The ratio of the $OD_{600}$ to the cell concentration was calculated at each point and multiplied by $10^9$ .

[[Average cell mass]] is known to vary strongly with the growth medium, being greater in media that support rapid growth (11). #Insight 

The [[doubling time]] during steady-state growth in [[Luria-Bertani]] broth was 20 min. #BioNumber #EColi 


The physiological state of **E. coli** cells in **Luria-Bertani** broth clearly varies significantly in the $OD_{660}$ range of 0.3 to 1.0. Many workers seem to be unaware that E. coli is no longer in steady-state growth at these relatively low ODs. #Insight 


### Growth in Luria-Bertani broth is carbon limited.

Why does growth stop at an $OD_{600}$ of 7? To address this question, we studied exhausted medium in which **E. coli** had grown to saturation. A culture of MG1655 was grown for 24 h in **Luria-Bertani** broth (final OD600 of 6.49). The bacteria were then removed by centrifugation and filtration. We call this conditioned medium LB*. Reinoculated with **MG1655**, LB* does not support further growth (OD600 of 0.01 in 24 h). When glucose was added to LB*, it once again supported growth to a final OD600 proportional to the amount of glucose added (Fig. 2). **This shows that LB* contains ample amounts of all of the essential inorganic nutrients. Thus, if growth arrest reflects the depletion of an essential nutrient (rather than toxification of the medium), the limiting metabolite must be a carbon source**. #CoolExperiment

### Luria-Bertani broth contains no fermentable sugars utilizable by E. coli.

> #NOTE That is, in [[LB]], E. coli.  can only grow significantly if oxygen is supplied. 

Our data indicate that Luria-Bertani broth contains <100 $\micro M$ fermentable sugar equivalents utilizable by E. coli (free sugars, sugar phosphates, oligosaccharides, nucleotides, etc.). #Insight 

### Availability of amino acids in Luria-Bertani broth.

Catabolizable amino acids recovered from these oligopeptides are the principal carbon sources in **Luria-Bertani** broth, accounting for the alkalinization of the medium during growth since amino acid catabolism results in excretion of the excess ammonium. #Insight
