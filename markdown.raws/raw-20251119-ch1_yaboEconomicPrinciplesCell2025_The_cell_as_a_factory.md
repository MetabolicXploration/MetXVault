# The cell as a factory {#FAC}

The term \"metabolism\" is usually used to describe the chemical
reactions that occur within biological organisms to produce and
transform molecules needed to sustain life. Although this definition is
useful, it does not give scientific or mathematical ground for the
analysis of metabolic systems. Here we consider metabolic systems in a
much broader sense, and in order to provide a logical framework for the
analysis of metabolic systems, we begin with a more formal definition
that also covers systems outside biology. Metabolic system: \"A
well-defined system that takes up nutrients and uses them to sustain
itself\". This definition can be represented by a simple chemical
equation:

$$\begin{equation*}
  \mbox{nutrients} \longrightarrow \mbox{metabolic system + waste products} 
\end{equation*}$$

The process is carried out by the metabolic system itself - a point we
will expand on later. The waste products are typical leftovers of the
reaction in case such products exist. The most obvious example of a
metabolic system is a biological system that takes up substances from
its environment and assimilates them to reproduce its own components
(often summarized as \"biomass\"). The chemical equation of metabolism
for biological systems is:

$$\begin{equation*}
  c_1~\mbox{sugar}+c_2~\mbox{oxygen}+c_3~\mbox{ammonia} \longrightarrow \mbox{biomass + waste products} 
\end{equation*}$$

The equation describes all the nutrients, including sugar, oxygen, and
ammonia, that are necessary to sustain a biological system. Other
molecules such as certain metals and phosphate are also necessary for
the reaction to occur, but we neglect them for the sake of brevity. The
typical waste products are water, carbon dioxide, and other possible
chemicals secreted by the system.

Another, less typical, example of a metabolic system in this general
sense is an economic firm supplying a product. In this example we will
consider for simplicity a firm that builds houses, but any kind of
product can be equally used. Such a firm takes in land and different
construction materials, these would be equivalent to the nutrients, and
by the use of the labor force, which would be equivalent to the
proteins, uses them to build houses. The houses are then sold to
maintain and increase the value of the firm, just as the biological cell
maintains itself. The chemical equation of metabolism for a construction
firm is: $$\begin{equation*}
  c_1~\mbox{land} + c_2~\mbox{construction materials} \longrightarrow \mbox{value} + c_3~\mbox{waste} 
\end{equation*}$$

In this book we focus on the analysis of biological metabolic systems.
However, given that economic systems fall under the same definition of a
metabolic system, we will use them as analogies to simplify
explanations. Whenever an analogy to economical systems is presented in
this book, it will be displayed in an \"Economic analogy\" box such as
the one above.

Many metabolic systems use a strategy of reproduction to sustain itself.
That is, nutrients are used to make more of the metabolic system and not
only to maintain it. This means that the output of the metabolic process
is more of the metabolic system. This creates a system that, when
unlimited resources are available, grows exponentially - the metabolic
system takes in nutrients which it uses to replicate, the output of the
process is also the metabolic system which takes in more nutrients and
also replicates. Metabolism includes all the processes that take place
in order to carry out the overall chemical conversion of metabolism -
that is, everything that happens inside the black box described above.
The most fundamental model of a metabolic system is one that takes
nutrients from the environment, breaks them down into building blocks,
and uses these building blocks to sustain itself. In biological systems,
these processes are termed catabolism and anabolism. In catabolism, the
cell takes up carbon and nitrogen sources from the environment and uses
them to synthesize the necessary building blocks: amino acids, nucleic
acids, and fatty acids. In the anabolic process, the building blocks are
used to form biomass which includes the functioning systems of the
cells, proteins, DNA strands, and the membrane. Each process is
catalyzed by a specific set of enzymes. These enzymes that catalyze the
reactions are actually the metabolic system itself. When the cell grows,
it makes more enzymes to catalyze more reactions - this is the
reproduction process that leads to exponential growth.

In an analogy to an economic system of a construction firm, the
catabolic process would correspond to the purchase and transfer of the
construction materials to the construction site, and the anabolic
processes would correspond to the construction of the house; the
catalytic enzymes would correspond to the workers carrying out the
transfer of the materials and construction process. The growth process
in bacteria is analogous to the growth of the firm - when the
construction of the house is complete, the house is then sold to
increase the value of the firm. The increased value enables the company
to hire more workers and build more houses.

The metabolic system controls the allocation of the available resources.
When coordinating the process, the metabolic system decides between
different strategies on how to best use the resources. For example, the
cell decides how much of the available enzymes to allocate to the
catabolic process and how much to the anabolic process. When making
these decisions, the cell takes into account different physical
constraints. Examples of these physical constraints are: a limited
physical volume to maintain and carry out the metabolic processes, a
limited surface area that constrains the ability to take up nutrients,
or limiting thermodynamic constraints on the activity of the enzymes.
There is no one best strategy that is always utilized - different
organisms decide on different strategies based on the living conditions.
This decision process is carried out by many mechanisms in the cell, the
main information processing core of the cell being DNA. The decisions
carried out by the cell are based on the evolutionary process the
metabolic system has gone through during its existence. A description of
cell information processing and how it is carried out is given in
Appendix A.

::: Ecoblock
In an analogy to the economic system of a construction company, the
company manager faces the decision of how to allocate his workforce, how
many of his workers to assign to bring in materials from the factory and
how many of his workers to assign to the construction process. In a
similar way to the biological system, there are different limiting
constraints, such as a difficult topographic construction site or
limited available resources. Unlike the biological cell, though, in
which the decision-making is embedded by the evolutionary processes,
here the decision is made by the manager of the construction site.

So far, we describe the most fundamental metabolic system. This is a
coarse-grained description in which the cell catabolizes nutrients into
one type of precursor and does not take into account all the processes
that take place in catabolism and anabolism. In a biological metabolic
system, the cell requires multiple different types of precursors, such
as amino acids, nucleic acids, and fatty acids. To create all the
different precursors, the cell takes in nutrients from the environment
and, through a set of chemical reactions, turns the nutrients into the
precursors that are necessary for the cell to sustain itself. Each
chemical reaction in the metabolic process is carried out by proteins.
The different precursors can be produced through different sets of
chemical reactions known as metabolic pathways, and the different
chemicals in the metabolic pathways are known as metabolites. The cell
decides which metabolic pathway to activate by producing the necessary
enzymes. In an analogy to the economic system of a construction company,
each chemical reaction is one process carried out by a worker -- for
example, the assembly of the frame of the house requires a carpenter,
while the next step in the construction pathway is to place the
foundation in the correct location, which is done by another worker. The
workers are analogous to enzymes, and the different parts necessary for
construction are the metabolites.

Many metabolic pathways have overlapping metabolite reactants and
products. Some of the key parameters that describe metabolic pathways
are the enzyme catalytic rates. These parameters describe the rate at
which the enzymes consume and produce metabolites and at which
concentration of reactants they saturate. In the analogy to the
construction firm, the enzymatic parameters are parameters that describe
the rate of work of each worker. Given that each metabolic pathway is
made up of a series of chemical reactions, each with different catalytic
rates, the different enzymes of each pathway must be coordinated
perfectly to avoid any excess buildup of metabolites - just like in a
factory assembly line, all the workers must be coordinated together to
avoid buildup of an intermediate.

In order to make sense of the complex network of metabolic reactions,
different mathematical models were developed. The models take into
account the known experimental data for the different reactions and
compile them together to predict the overall response of the system
under different growth conditions.

The metabolic models described above describe biological systems that
are disconnected from the environment except for some artificial supply
of nutrients. In natural ecological systems, different organisms exist
together under a limited supply of nutrients. They compete or cooperate
to best utilize the limited available resources. All organisms try to
improve their chances of survival according to the laws of evolution. In
such a setting, the metabolism of organisms living in an ecological
system is directly dependent on the other organisms that co-exist with
them. In an analogy to an economic system, this would be a competition
between different companies for the same possible clientele. Some
companies would compete against each other, while others would cooperate
to improve their profit.
